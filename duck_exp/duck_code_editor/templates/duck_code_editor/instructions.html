  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Please read and follow the instructions before each task! The results of our
    experiment hinge on it.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Each task will be introduced by a description of the code, some example
        input/output. Your output after debugging should exactly match that of
        the examples.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        You will receive a piece of code that compiles correctly but produces
        incorrect or unexpected output. In other words, all bugs are of a
        semantic nature: There is something wrong with the logic of the code,
        NOT the syntax, style, or organisation of it.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Do NOT use external tools during debugging. You may only rely on your
        own knowledge.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Do NOT import new libraries. Any needed libraries will already be
        included.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Do NOT define new functions. Only edit any existing ones.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        When you think your code is corrected, or when you decide you cannot fix
        it, please press next. You will not be able to return after proceeding,
        so make sure you are certain that you are done before moving on.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Letâ€™s proceed with a test task to get you warmed up.</p>
